            SECTION 10: FOOD SUBSTITUTION POLICY
            
            Although FoodieFit takes every reasonable measure to obtain sufficient inventory to fill your order, availability of product(s) may change without notice. FoodieFit is not responsible for unavailability of product due to popular demand or discontinuation.

            FoodieFit reserves the right to substitute an unavailable product with a similar product. When making substitutions, FoodieFit will attempt to meet the requirements of your particular FoodieFit meal plan. Substituted food items may contain different ingredients and allergens than those in items originally ordered. If you have any food allergies or if you are otherwise concerned about any particular ingredients, please be sure to carefully check all individual product packages for the most updated information regarding ingredients and nutritional content prior to consumption of any of FoodieFit’s food products.

            SECTION 12: PRODUCT DISPLAY
            
            We have made every effort to accurately display the Products featured on the Website.

As such, we cannot guarantee that your monitor’s display will be accurate.

             

            SECTION 13: CREDIT CARD SECURITY
            
            FoodieFit is committed to protecting any information you give us during a credit card transaction. FoodieFit uses a third-party vendor to process all credit card payments. FoodieFit does not have access to your credit card information. To extent that FoodieFit may, in the future, have access to your credit card information, we will treat it as personal information covered by our Privacy Policy.

            In accordance with our Privacy Policy, we will not share the information. In accordance with industry custom, we enforce commercially reasonable security measures to protect against the loss or misuse of any personal information that we have collected from you.

            PLEASE NOTE THAT NORMAL E-MAIL (SUCH AS USING “CONTACT US” OR YOUR HOME E-MAIL) IS NOT ENCRYPTED AND THUS IS NOT A SECURE MEANS FOR TRANSMITTING CREDIT CARD INFORMATION OR ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION YOU WISH TO KEEP PRIVATE AND SECURE.

             

            SECTION 14: PAYMENT
            
            FoodieFit currently accepts Visa, MasterCard, Discover and American Express for all orders. Payment for Products ordered will be processed at the time of placing such order. You agree to pay promptly all charges to your account (which includes items purchased and applicable taxes) for any order placed by you or anyone who you allow to use your customer identification number or password, including members of your family, friends or any other person. For your order to be accepted, your method of payment shall be validated and must have enough available funds required for the transaction. Upon approval, the order will be accepted for shipping and delivery. FoodieFit reserves the right to establish a spending limit for your account. Your right to order Products is also subject to limits established by your payment card issuer.

             

            SECTION 15: REFUND POLICY
            
            If you are dissatisfied with a meal, meal ingredient or a meal’s appearance on arrival, please contact us at info@foodiefit.com and our customer service agents will research the incident, and at their discretion, may offer credit in the form of FoodieFit credit to the customer account. We may require photographic documentation of any meal with which you are dissatisfied before we issue a credit. Meals that did not meet your taste preferences do not constitute an automatic refund and are taken on a case by case basis.

             

            Refund requests must be made by phone or email within 7 days of delivery. Meals that arrive unfit can be credited to the account for use in a future order. We value photos of any improper food arrival to continue improving our packaging. A customer service agent may request photographs be sent to accompany the reported complaint. We encourage all customers to remove meals immediately from their box and place in the refrigerator, inspecting containers as they are transferred.

            Meals delayed by our third-party courier must be communicated with our team in urgency so we may try to resolve this issue. Credit on orders that did not arrive due to courier or FoodieFit fault will be given in the form of FoodieFit credit to the customer account. FoodieFit is not liable for packages undelivered due to incorrect addresses submitted by the customer. Orders may be modified or canceled up to 48 hours prior to the delivery day and time via our website or by contacting us at info@foodiefit.com. We are unable to modify or cancel orders once the cutoff has passed as ingredients have been ordered.

             

            SECTION 16: OVERVIEW OF SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES
            
            For your convenience, FoodieFit offers subscription services whereby you select a set of meals and a delivery date of your choosing and FoodieFit sends those meals to the location you have selected on a weekly basis.

             

            SECTION 17: BILLING FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES
            
            For subscription customers FoodieFit will bill the credit card on file on Saturday prior to delivery date. By subscribing to our service, you are agreeing to pay recurring periodic subscriptions for an indefinite period of time until cancelled by you or us. You will not receive any advance notice of this payment, but you will receive post-payment confirmation by email. It is your responsibility to maintain current, valid payment information with FoodieFit. If your automatic recurring payment is declined, you will be contacted by phone or email. If we cannot contact you, we cannot guarantee that your meals will be shipped.

             

            SECTION 18: ORDER CANCELLATION FOR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES
            
            Subscription customers have the ability to select, change, pause, or cancel a meal delivery up to 48 hours prior to the delivery day and time. Orders cannot be modified or canceled after the cut-off time. Unless notified by the subscriber prior to the cut-off, FoodieFit will prepare and ship the meals selected in accordance with subscription terms and bill the credit card on file in accordance with our normal billing procedures. Order cancellations must be submitted prior to the cut-off time to take effect for the next week’s delivery.

             

            SECTION 19: CONTINUOUS SUBSCRIPTIONS
            
            WHEN YOU REGISTER FOR A SUBSCRIPTION (AND EACH TIME YOU CHANGE YOUR PLAN), YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT FoodieFit (OR OUR THIRD-PARTY PAYMENT PROCESSOR) IS AUTHORIZED TO CHARGE YOU ON A WEEKLY BASIS FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION (IN ADDITION TO ANY APPLICABLE TAXES AND OTHER CHARGES) FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD OF TIME UNTIL CANCELED BY YOU OR US. THE AMOUNT YOU ARE CHARGED AND THE NUMBER OF MEALS YOU RECEIVE EACH WEEK MAY VARY DEPENDING ON THE PREFERENCES YOU SELECT. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT FOODIE FIT WILL NOT OBTAIN ANY ADDITIONAL AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU FOR SUCH AUTOMATIC, RECURRING PAYMENTS.

In all of these cases, we will collect personal information from you only if you voluntarily submit such information to us. Unless you give us permission to do so, we will not sell, share, license, trade or rent your personal information other than as specified in this Privacy Policy.

            You do not have to provide us with any personal information to visit our Website, although we automatically collect certain information about your web browser or mobile device, as discussed below. If you choose to withhold requested information, you may not be able to order our Products.

            When you use or browse our Website, we collect information that is automatically sent to us by your web browser or mobile device. This information typically includes your user IP address, browser type, domain name, and other statistical data involving the use of our Website.

            The information we receive may depend on your browser or device settings. This information is used to help us understand who uses our Website and to improve and market our Website and Products in general. We may also supplement the personal information we collect with information from other sources to assist us in evaluating and improving our Website and Products, to determine your preferences so that we can tailor our Website and Products to your needs, and to study nutritional, behavioral, and fitness questions in general.

            We work with a third-party service provider to offer our Internet-based nutrition counseling services. If you participate in these services, our service provider may collect additional personal information about you, including, but not limited to, your physical characteristics, eating habits and caloric intake, sleeping habits, changes in weight, and your progress with respect to exercises and activities.

            SECTION 3: WHERE & WHEN IS PERSONAL INFORMATION COLLECTED?
            
            We collect personal information from you in different manners and at different places and times on our Website, such as when you register to visit a certain page on our Website or order Products. The following is a description of the areas and/or manners in which we primarily collect information about you.

            Becoming a Registered User. In order to use our Website for purchasing our Products, you must first complete certain steps to become a registered user. During these steps, you may be required to provide us with personal information. This information is used to help us understand who uses our Website, to improve our Website, to monitor and improve our online ordering process, and to contact users with regards to their use of our Website and the purchase of our Products. We encourage you to provide demographic information so that we can provide a more personalized experience on our Website.

            Cookies and Action Tags. We also collect personal information passively using “cookies” and “action tags”. “Cookies” are small text files that are placed on your computer or mobile device in order to identify:

            (i) your Web browser;

            (ii) the activities of your computer on our Website; and

            (iii) your activity in connection with our advertisements and other marketing and promotional efforts.

            If you “opt-in” (for example, if you check a box, or if the box is pre-checked, you do not opt out by unchecking the box) we may send you electronic newsletters, contact you about our Products, provide you with news that may be of interest to you, and provide you with targeted feedback. If you no longer desire to receive these communications, we will provide you with an option to change your preferences. In addition, if you identify yourself to us by sending us an email with questions or comments, we may use your personal information to respond to your questions or comments, and we may file your questions or comments for future reference. We may also use the information collected to contact you about important service announcements and updates regarding our Website or Products. If you are a registered user, we may use the information to contact you about your account. You will not be able to opt-out of these service announcements and updates as they contain important information relevant to your use of our Website or with non-promotional information about our Products. If you do not wish to receive these service announcements, you may cancel your account with us. We may also use the information gathered on our Website and Products ordered by you to perform statistical analysis of user behavior; to analyze and evaluate issues relating to nutrition, behavior and fitness; or to evaluate and improve our Products. We may link some of this information to personal information for internal purposes only.

            Cookies may be used to: personalize your experience on our Website (e.g., to dynamically generate content on web pages specifically designed for you); assist you in ordering our Products (e.g., to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website); and allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website for purposes of improving our online offerings. We also may use cookies to conduct marketing and promotional efforts, tailor certain advertisements to your browser that we think may be of interest to you, or to determine the popularity of certain Products or content.

            We may link the information stored in cookies to personal information you provide us. To personalize your Website experience, we may store Personally Identifiable Information in an encrypted form in temporary or “session” cookies, that are erased when you close your browser. You do not have to accept cookies to use our Website; however, you may not be able to use our Website to its fullest advantage if you do not accept cookies. Although most browsers are initially set to accept cookies, you may reset your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie or to reject cookies generally. Most browsers offer instructions on how to do so in the “Help” section of the toolbar.

            “Action tags”, also known as web beacons or GIF tags, are a web technology used to help track anonymous website usage information, such as how many times a specific page has been viewed. Action tags are invisible to you. Any portion of our Website, including advertisements or e-mail sent on our behalf, may contain action tags. Unlike cookies, action tags are not placed on your computer. For example, third-party ad servers may track anonymous website usage through action tags on our Website and other websites. They do this by setting a cookie (or reading a cookie previously placed by them) on users’ computers to track the activities of users who view a web page that contains action tags. Third-party ad servers may use information about your visits to this Website in order to provide advertisements about goods and services that may be of interest to you. They may report the anonymous data that they collect on our behalf back to us for our internal use and analysis. Our treatment of this anonymous data is governed by the terms of this Privacy Policy.

            By using cookies and action tags together, we are able to gain valuable information to improve our Website and our Products. We do not disclose any of your personal information to our advertising partners through the use of cookies or action tags.

            Finally, please note that advertisers and other third parties may also use their own cookies or action tags when you click on their advertisement or link to their website or service, on or from our Website.

            Social Media (Features) and Widgets. Our Website includes social media features, such as the Facebook Like button and other Widgets such as the Share this button (collectively, the “Features”). These Features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on our Website, and may set a cookie to enable the Features to function properly. The Features are either hosted by a third party or directly on our Website. Your interactions with these Features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it.

            Log Files. We also collect personal information through our internet log files, which record data such as user IP addresses, browser types, domain names, and other statistical data involving the use of our Website. This information may be used to analyze trends, administer the Website, monitor our Website’s use, and gather general demographic information. We may link this information to personal information for these and other purposes such as personalizing your experience on our Website.

             

            SECTION 4: UNDERAGE DATA COLLECTION
            
            We are committed to protecting the privacy of children. Our Website and Products are not designed for or directed to children under the age of 13. We do not collect personal information from any person we actually know is under the age of 13. We urge all parents or guardians to participate in their children’s exploration of the internet and to teach their children about protecting their personal information while online.

             

            SECTION 5: THIRD PARTY DATA DISCLOSURES
            
            Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy or as specifically agreed to by you, we will not disclose any information we gather from you.

            (i) If we believe in good faith that we are required to do so in order to comply with an applicable statute, regulation, rule or law, a subpoena, a search warrant, a court or regulatory order, or other valid legal process.

            (ii) When we have reason to believe that disclosing this information is necessary to identify, contact, or bring legal action against someone who may be violating our Terms and Conditions.

            (iii) To protect the safety and security of our users, our Website, or the general public.

            (iv) In the event that we are subject to mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, sales of assets, reorganizations, divestitures, dissolutions, bankruptcies, liquidations, or other types of business transactions. In these types of transactions, personal information may be shared, sold, or transferred, and it may be used subsequently by a third party.

            Third Parties Generally. We may provide to third parties information about you that does not allow you to be identified or contacted, including where such information is combined with similar information of other users of our Website. For example, we might inform third parties regarding the number of unique users who visit our Website, the demographic breakdown of the registered users of our Website, or the activities that visitors to our Website engage in while on our Website. The third parties to which we may provide this information may include our webmaster, potential or actual advertisers, providers of advertising services (including website tracking services), commercial partners, sponsors, licensees, researchers, and other similar parties.

            Outside Contractors. We may employ independent contractors, vendors, and suppliers (collectively, “Outside Contractors”) to provide specific services and products related to our Website or our Products, such as providing payment processing and fraud screening, and developing applications for our Website and e-mail services. These Outside Contractors may sometimes have limited access to information collected on our Website, including your personal information, in the course of providing products or services to us. Access to your personal information by these contractors is limited to the information reasonably necessary in order for the Outside Contractors to perform their limited function for us. We also require that these Outside Contractors (i) protect the privacy of your personal information consistent with this Privacy Policy, and (ii) not use or disclose your personal information for any purpose other than providing us with products or services for which we contracted.

             

            SECTION 6: THIRD PARTY WEBSITE LINKS
            
            Our Website may contain links to other websites not owned or operated by Foodie Fit. We will attempt to make it obvious to you when you leave our Website and enter these websites by opening a new browser or otherwise notifying you that you are leaving our Website. However, please be aware that we are not responsible for the privacy practices of such websites. We encourage you to be aware when our Website links to other websites and to read the privacy policies or statements of each and every website. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information collected by us.

             

            SECTION 7: YOUR DATA IS SAFE & SECURE
            
            We want your personal information to remain as secure as possible. We strive to provide secure transmission of your information from your computer to our servers through industry-standard techniques. To help ensure the integrity and privacy of the personal information you provide to us via the Internet at the time you elect to become a registered user, we use Secured Socket Layer (SSL) encryption technology in transmitting such personal information over the Internet to our servers. We secure the personal information you provide on servers located in controlled, secure environments, protected from unauthorized access, use, or alteration. Only employees who need access to your information to perform a specific task or function are granted access to such information. All FoodieFit employees must abide by this Privacy Policy and are kept up to date on security practices. Any employee who violates this Privacy Policy is subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination. Notwithstanding the above commitments to protect your personal information from loss, misuse or alteration by third parties, you should be aware that there is always some risk involved in transmitting information over the internet. There is also some risk that others could find a way to thwart our security systems. As a result, while we strive to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security and privacy of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk.

             

            SECTION 8: DATA PREFERENCES

            YOUR ACCOUNT
            You can always contact us by sending an email to info@foodiefit.com in order to:

            (i) update or correct your personal information.

            (ii) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us.

            (iii) delete the personal information maintained about you on our systems. You can also delete your personal information by logging onto our web site by using your username and password.

            Such updates, corrections, changes, and deletions will not have an effect on other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change, or deletion. You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the information you have provided to us from our systems. The need to back-up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss means that a copy of your personal information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us to locate. We promise that promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use and other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate. We will respond to your request within 30 days.

            EMAIL
            You cannot opt out of transactional emails related to your membership/registration with our Website. However, you can opt out of promotional emails we send you. If you wish to stop receiving promotional emails, simply select “unsubscribe” located at the bottom of each communication.

            COOKIES
            Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can change your browser’s settings to disable all or certain cookies if you wish. Please note that by disabling or deleting cookies, you may not be able to access the full functionality of our Site. Disabling or clearing cookies also may affect cookie-based opt-outs by either preventing you from using such cookie-based opt-outs or clearing opt-outs that you previously set.

            DO NOT TRACK
            Because there currently is not an industry or legal standard for recognizing or honoring Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals, we do not respond to them at this time.

            LOCATION
            Our Website is hosted and operated in the United States. However, we and our service providers may store information about individuals in the United States, or we may transfer it to, and store it within, other countries.

            Visitors from jurisdictions outside the United States visit us at their own choice and risk.

            If you are not a resident of the United States, you acknowledge and agree that we may collect and use your personal information outside your home jurisdiction, and that we may store your personal information in the United States or elsewhere. Please note that the level of legal protection provided in the United States from which you may access our Website may not be as stringent as that under privacy standards or the privacy laws of other countries, possibly including your home jurisdiction.

             

            SECTION 9: PRIVACY POLICY UPDATES
            
            If we decide to change this Privacy Policy, we will post those changes on our Website so you are always aware of what information we collect, how we use it, and under what circumstances, if any, we disclose it. If at any point we decide to use personal information in a manner significantly different from that stated in this Privacy Policy, or otherwise disclosed to you, at the time it was collected, we will notify you by email or otherwise, and you will have a choice as to whether or not we use your personal information in the new manner. We may also make non-significant changes to our Privacy Policy that generally will not affect our use of your personal information. If you do not agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy, you should not use our Website.
